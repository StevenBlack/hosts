# @EXTENSIONS_HEADER@

This repository consolidates several reputable `hosts` files, and merges them
into a unified hosts file with duplicates removed. A variety of tailored hosts
files are provided.

**Therefore this repository is a hosts file aggregator.**

![Aggregator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/aggregator.png)

- Last updated: **@GEN_DATE@**.
- Here's the
  [raw hosts file @EXTENSIONS_HEADER@](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/@SUBFOLDER@hosts)
  containing @NUM_ENTRIES@ entries.

## List of all hosts file variants

This repository offers
[31 different host file variants](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/tree/master/alternates),
in addition to the base variant, with and without the unified hosts included.

The **Non GitHub mirror** is the link to use for some hosts file managers like
[Hostsman for Windows](https://www.abelhadigital.com/hostsman/) that don't work
with GitHub download links.

| Host file recipe | Readme | Raw hosts | Unique domains | Non GitHub mirror |
| ---------------- | :----: | :-------: | :------------: | :---------------: |
@TOCROWS@

**Expectation**: These unified hosts files should serve all devices, regardless
of OS.

## Sources of hosts data unified in this variant

Updated `hosts` files from the following locations are always unified and
included:

| Host file source | Home page | Raw hosts | License | Issues | Description |
| ---------------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-----: | :----: | ----------- |
@SOURCEROWS@

## Extensions

The unified hosts file is optionally extensible. Extensions are used to include
domains by category. Currently, we offer the following categories: `fakenews`,
`social`, `gambling`, and `porn`.

Extensions are optional, and can be combined in various ways with the base hosts
file. The combined products are stored in the
[`alternates`](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/tree/master/alternates)
folder.

Data for extensions are stored in the
[`extensions`](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/tree/master/extensions)
folder. You manage extensions by curating this folder tree, where you will find
the data for `fakenews`, `social`, `gambling`, and `porn` extension data that we
maintain and provide for you.

## Generate your own unified hosts file

You have three options to generate your own hosts file. You can use our
container image, build your own image, or do it in your own environment. Option
#1 is easiest if you have Linux with Docker installed.

### Option 1: Use our container image (Linux only)

> This will replace your `/etc/hosts`.

We assume you have Docker available on your host. Just run the following
command. Set extensions to your preference.

```sh
docker run --pull always --rm -it -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts \
ghcr.io/stevenblack/hosts:latest updateHostsFile.py --auto \
--replace --extensions gambling porn
```

If you want to add custom hosts or a whitelist, create either or both files as
per [the instructions](#how-do-i-control-which-sources-are-unified) and add the
following arguments _before_ `ghcr.io/stevenblack/hosts:latest` depending on
which you wish to use.

```sh
-v "path/to/myhosts:/hosts/myhosts" \
-v "path/to/whitelist:/hosts/whitelist" \
```

You can rerun this exact command later to update based on the latest available
hosts (for example, add it to a weekly cron job).

### Option 2: Generate your own container image

We provide the
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/Dockerfile) used
by the previous step, which you can use to create a container image with
everything you need. The container will contain Python 3 and all its dependency
requirements, and a copy of the latest version of this repository.

Build the Docker container from the root of this repo like this:

```sh
docker build --no-cache . -t stevenblack-hosts
```

Then run your command as such:

```sh
docker run --rm -it stevenblack-hosts updateHostsFile.py
```

> This will create the hosts file, and remove it with the container when done,
> so not very useful. You can use the example in option #1 to add volumes so
> files on your host are replaced.

### Option 3: Generate it in your own environment

To generate your own amalgamated hosts files you will need Python 3.6 or later.

First, install the dependencies with:

```sh
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

**Note** we recommend the `--user` flag which installs the required dependencies
at the user level. More information about it can be found on pip
[documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/?highlight=--user#cmdoption-user).

### Option 4: Generate it in Google Colab

Spin up a free remote [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tYWXpU2iuPDqN_o03JW9ml3ExO80eBLq?usp=sharing) environment.

### Common steps regardless of your development environment

To **run unit tests**, in the top-level directory, run:

```sh
python3 testUpdateHostsFile.py
```

The `updateHostsFile.py` script will generate a unified hosts file based on the
sources in the local `data/` subfolder. The script will prompt you whether it
should fetch updated versions (from locations defined by the `update.json` text
file in each source's folder). Otherwise, it will use the `hosts` file that's
already there.

```sh
python3 updateHostsFile.py [--auto] [--replace] [--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn] [--extensions ext1 ext2 ext3]
```

#### Command line options

`--help`, or `-h`: display help.

`--auto`, or `-a`: run the script without prompting. When `--auto` is invoked,

- Hosts data sources, including extensions, are updated.
- No extensions are included by default. Use the `--extensions` or `-e` flag to
  include any you want.
- Your active hosts file is _not_ replaced unless you include the `--replace`
  flag.

`--backup`, or `-b`: Make a backup of existing hosts file(s) as you generate
over them.

`--extensions <ext1> <ext2> <ext3>`, or `-e <ext1> <ext2> <ext3>`: the names of
subfolders below the `extensions` folder containing additional category-specific
hosts files to include in the amalgamation. Example: `--extensions porn` or
`-e social porn`.

`--flush-dns-cache`, or `-f`: skip the prompt for flushing the DNS cache. Only
active when `--replace` is also active.

`--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn`, or `-i nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn`: the IP address to use as the
target. Default is `0.0.0.0`.

`--keepdomaincomments`, or `-k`: `true` (default) or `false`, keep the comments
that appear on the same line as domains. The default is `true`.

`--noupdate`, or `-n`: skip fetching updates from hosts data sources.

`--output <subfolder>`, or `-o <subfolder>`: place the generated source file in
a subfolder. If the subfolder does not exist, it will be created.

`--replace`, or `-r`: trigger replacing your active hosts

`--skipstatichosts`, or `-s`: `false` (default) or `true`, omit the standard
section at the top, containing lines like `127.0.0.1 localhost`. This is useful
for configuring proximate DNS services on the local network.

`--nogendata`, or `-g`: `false` (default) or `true`, skip the generation of the
readmeData.json file used for generating readme.md files. This is useful if you
are generating host files with additional whitelists or blacklists and want to
keep your local checkout of this repo unmodified.

`--nounifiedhosts`: `false` (default) or `true`, do not include the unified hosts
file in the final hosts file. Usually used together with `--extensions`.

`--compress`, or `-c`: `false` (default) or `true`, _Compress_ the hosts file
ignoring non-necessary lines (empty lines and comments) and putting multiple
domains in each line. Reducing the number of lines of the hosts file improves
the performances under Windows (with DNS Client service enabled).

`--minimise`, or `-m`: `false` (default) or `true`, like `--compress`, but puts
each domain on a separate line. This is necessary because many implementations
of URL blockers that rely on `hosts` files do not conform to the standard which
allows multiple hosts on a single line.

`--blacklist <blacklistfile>`, or `-x <blacklistfile>`: Append the given
blacklist file in hosts format to the generated hosts file.

`--whitelist <whitelistfile>`, or `-w <whitelistfile>`: Use the given whitelist
file to remove hosts from the generated hosts file.

## How do I control which sources are unified?

Add one or more _additional_ sources, each in a subfolder of the `data/` folder,
and specify the `url` key in its `update.json` file.

Add one or more _optional_ extensions, which originate from subfolders of the
`extensions/` folder. Again the url in `update.json` controls where this
extension finds its updates.

Create an _optional_ `blacklist` file. The contents of this file (containing a
listing of additional domains in `hosts` file format) are appended to the
unified hosts file during the update process. A sample `blacklist` is included,
and may be modified as you need.

- NOTE: The `blacklist` is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be
  overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.

### How do I include my own custom domain mappings?

If you have custom hosts records, place them in file `myhosts`. The contents of
this file are prepended to the unified hosts file during the update process.

The `myhosts` file is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be
overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.

### How do I prevent domains from being included?

The domains you list in the `whitelist` file are excluded from the final hosts
file.

The `whitelist` uses partial matching. Therefore if you whitelist
`google-analytics.com`, that domain and all its subdomains won't be merged into
the final hosts file.

The `whitelist` is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be
overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.

## How can I contribute hosts records?

If you discover sketchy domains you feel should be included here, here are some
ways to contribute them.

### Option 1: contact one of our hosts sources

The best way to get new domains included is to submit an issue to any of the
data providers whose home pages are
[listed here](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts#sources-of-hosts-data-unified-in-this-variant).
This is best because once you submit new domains, they will be curated and
updated by the dedicated folks who maintain these sources.

### Option 2: Fork this repository, add your domains to Steven Black's personal data file, and submit a pull request

Fork this hosts this repo and add your links to
[https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/data/StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/data/StevenBlack/hosts).

Then, submit a pull request.

**WARNING**: this is less desirable than Option 1 because the ongoing curation
falls on us. So this creates more work for us.

### Option 3: create your own hosts list as a repo on GitHub

If you're able to curate your own collection of sketchy domains, then curate
your own hosts list. Then signal the existence of your repo as
[a new issue](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/issues) and we may include
your new repo into the collection of sources we pull whenever we create new
versions.

## What is a hosts file?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file used
by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`. Therefore
if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never leaves your
computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware,
and other irritants.

For example, to nullify requests to some doubleclick.net servers, adding these
lines to your hosts file will do it:

```text
# block doubleClick's servers
0.0.0.0 ad.ae.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.ar.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.at.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.au.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.be.doubleclick.net
# etc...
```

## We recommend using `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`

Traditionally most host files use `127.0.0.1`, the _loopback address_, to
establish an IP connection to the local machine.

We prefer to use `0.0.0.0`, which is defined as a non-routable meta-address used
to designate an invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target.

Using `0.0.0.0` is empirically faster, possibly because there's no wait for a
timeout resolution. It also does not interfere with a web server that may be
running on the local PC.

## Why not use `0` instead of `0.0.0.0`?

We tried that. Using `0` doesn't work universally.

## Location of your hosts file

To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and
modify it with a text editor.

- **macOS (until 10.14.x macOS Mojave), iOS, Android, Linux**: `/etc/hosts`
  file.
- **macOS Catalina:** `/private/etc/hosts` file.
- **Windows**: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` file.

## Gentoo

Gentoo users may find
[`sb-hosts`](https://github.com/PF4Public/gentoo-overlay/tree/master/net-misc/sb-hosts)
in [::pf4public](https://github.com/PF4Public/gentoo-overlay) Gentoo overlay

## NixOS

To install hosts file on your machine add the following into your
`configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  networking.extraHosts = let
    hostsPath = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts;
    hostsFile = builtins.fetchurl hostsPath;
  in builtins.readFile "${hostsFile}";
}
```

- NOTE: Change `hostsPath` if you need other versions of hosts file.
- NOTE: The call to `fetchurl` is impure. Use `fetchFromGitHub` with the exact
  commit if you want to always get the same result.

### Nix Flake

NixOS installations which are managed through _flakes_ can use the hosts file
like this:

```nix
{
  inputs.hosts.url = "github:StevenBlack/hosts";
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, hosts }: {
    nixosConfigurations.my-hostname = {
      system = "<architecture>";
      modules = [
        hosts.nixosModule {
          networking.stevenBlackHosts.enable = true;
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

The hosts extensions are also available with the following options:

```nix
{
  networking.stevenBlackHosts = {
    blockFakenews = true;
    blockGambling = true;
    blockPorn = true;
    blockSocial = true;
  };
}
```

## Updating hosts file on Windows

(NOTE: See also some third-party Hosts managers, listed below.)

On Linux and macOS, run the Python script. On Windows more work is required due
to compatibility issues so it's preferable to run the batch file as follows:

```sh
updateHostsWindows.bat
```

This file **MUST** be run in command prompt with administrator privileges in the
repository directory. In addition to updating the hosts file, it can also
replace the existing hosts file, and reload the DNS cache. It goes without
saying that for this to work, you must be connected to the internet.

To open a command prompt as administrator in the repository's directory, do the
following:

- **Windows XP**: Start → Run → `cmd`
- **Windows Vista, 7**: Start Button → type `cmd` → right-click Command Prompt →
  "Run as Administrator"
- **Windows 8**: Start → Swipe Up → All Apps → Windows System → right-click
  Command Prompt → "Run as Administrator"
- **Windows 10**: Start Button → type `cmd` → right-click Command Prompt → "Run
  as Administrator"

You can also refer to the "Third-Party Hosts Managers" section for further
recommended solutions from third parties.

### Warning: Using this `hosts` file in Windows may require disabling DNS Cache service

Windows has issues with larger hosts files. Recent changes in security within
Windows 10 denies access to changing services via other tools except registry
hacks. Use the `disable-dnscache-service-win.cmd` file to make proper changes to
the Windows registry. You will need to reboot your device once that's done. See
the
[the comments within the `cmd` file](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/disable-dnscache-service-win.bat)
for more details.

Disabling the DNS Cache Service can cause issues with services and applications like *WSL* and it's possible to compress the hosts file and negate the need to disable the DNS caching service. You can try the *C++* Windows command line tool at [Hosts Compress - Windows](https://github.com/Lateralus138/hosts-compress-windows) (the recommended method) or the *PowerShell* compression script and check out the guide located at the [Hosts Compression Scripts](https://github.com/Lateralus138/hosts-compression-scripts) repository.

## Reloading hosts file

Your operating system will cache DNS lookups. You can either reboot or run the
following commands to manually flush your DNS cache once the new hosts file is
in place.

The Google Chrome browser may require manually cleaning up its DNS Cache on
`chrome://net-internals/#dns` page to thereafter see the changes in your hosts
file. See: <https://superuser.com/questions/723703>

### Windows

Open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run this command:

```bat
ipconfig /flushdns
```

### Linux

Open a Terminal and run with root privileges:

- **Debian/Ubuntu** `sudo service network-manager restart`
- **Linux Mint** `sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean start`
- **Linux with systemd**: `sudo systemctl restart network.service`
- **Fedora Linux**: `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`
- **Arch Linux/Manjaro with Network Manager**:
  `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`
- **Arch Linux/Manjaro with Wicd**: `sudo systemctl restart wicd.service`
- **RHEL/Centos**: `sudo /etc/init.d/network restart`
- **FreeBSD**: `sudo service nscd restart`

  To enable the `nscd` daemon initially, it is recommended that you run the
  following commands:

  ```sh
  sudo sysrc nscd_enable="YES"
  sudo service nscd start
  ```

  Then modify the `hosts` line in your `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file to the
  following:

  ```text
  hosts: cache files dns
  ```

- **NixOS**: The `nscd.service` is automatically restarted when the option
  `networking.extraHosts` was changed.
- **Others**: Consult
  [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29#Location_in_the_file_system).

### macOS

As described in [this article](https://osxdaily.com/2022/11/21/how-clear-dns-cache-macos-ventura-monterey/),
open a Terminal and run:

```sh
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

## Release management

This repository uses [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it), an
excellent CLI release tool for GitHub repos and npm packages, to automate
creating [releases](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/releases). This is why
the
[package.json](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/package.json)
and
[.release-it.json](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/.release-it.json)
files are bundled.

## Goals of this unified hosts file

The goals of this repo are to:

1. automatically combine high-quality lists of hosts,
2. provide situation-appropriate extensions,
3. de-dupe the resultant combined list,
4. and keep the resultant file reasonably sized.

A high-quality source is defined here as one that is actively curated. A hosts
source should be frequently updated by its maintainers with both additions and
removals. The larger the hosts file, the higher the level of curation is
expected.

It is expected that this unified hosts file will serve both desktop and mobile
devices under a variety of operating systems.

## Third-Party Hosts Managers
