# Unified hosts file with gambling extensions

This repository consolidates several reputable `hosts` files, and merges them
into a unified hosts file with duplicates removed.  A variety of tailored hosts files are provided.

* Last updated: **October 09 2020**.
* Here's the [raw hosts file with gambling extensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/gambling/hosts) containing 58,974 entries.
* Logo by [@Tobaloidee](https://github.com/Tobaloidee).


## List of all hosts file variants

This repository offers [15 different host file variants](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/tree/master/alternates), in addition to the base variant.

The **Non GitHub mirror** is the link to use for some hosts file managers like
[Hostsman for Windows](http://www.abelhadigital.com/hostsman/) that don't work
with GitHub download links.

## Extensions

The unified hosts file is optionally extensible.  Extensions are used to include domains by category.  Currently, we offer the following categories: `fakenews`, `social`, `gambling`, and `porn`.

Extensions are optional, and can be combined in various ways with the base hosts file.  The combined products are stored in the [`alternates`](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/tree/master/alternates) folder.

Data for extensions are stored in the [`extensions`](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/tree/master/extensions) folder. You manage extensions by curating this
folder tree, where you will find the data for `fakenews`, `social`, `gambling`, and `porn` extension data that we maintain and provide for you.

## Generate your own unified hosts file

To generate your own unified hosts file you will need Python 3.5 or later.

First, install the dependencies with:

```sh
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

**Note** we recommend the `--user` flag which installs the required dependencies at the user level. More information about it can be found on pip [documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/?highlight=--user#cmdoption-user).

To run unit tests, in the top-level directory, run:

```sh
python3 testUpdateHostsFile.py
```

The `updateHostsFile.py` script will generate a unified hosts file based on the sources in the
local `data/` subfolder.  The script will prompt you whether it should fetch updated versions
(from locations defined by the `update.json` text file in each source's folder). Otherwise, it
will use the `hosts` file that's already there.

### Usage

#### Using Python 3:

```sh
python3 updateHostsFile.py [--auto] [--replace] [--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn] [--extensions ext1 ext2 ext3]
```

#### Command line options:

`--help`, or `-h`: display help.

`--auto`, or `-a`: run the script without prompting. When `--auto` is invoked,

* Hosts data sources, including extensions, are updated.
* No extensions are included by default.  Use the `--extensions` or `-e` flag
to include any you want.
* Your active hosts file is *not* replaced unless you include the `--replace`
flag.

`--backup`, or `-b`: Make a backup of existing hosts file(s) as you generate
over them.

`--extensions <ext1> <ext2> <ext3>`, or `-e <ext1> <ext2> <ext3>`: the names
of subfolders below the `extensions` folder containing additional
category-specific hosts files to include in the amalgamation. Example:
`--extensions porn` or `-e social porn`.

`--flush-dns-cache`, or `-f`: skip the prompt for flushing the DNS cache.
Only active when `--replace` is also active.

`--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn`, or `-i nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn`: the IP address to use as the
target.  Default is `0.0.0.0`.

`--keepdomaincomments`, or `-k`: `true` (default) or `false`, keep the comments
that appear on the same line as domains.  The default is `true`.

`--noupdate`, or `-n`: skip fetching updates from hosts data sources.

`--output <subfolder>`, or `-o <subfolder>`: place the generated source file
in a subfolder.  If the subfolder does not exist, it will be created.

`--replace`, or `-r`: trigger replacing your active hosts

`--skipstatichosts`, or `-s`: `false` (default) or `true`, omit the standard
section at the top, containing lines like `127.0.0.1 localhost`.  This is
useful for configuring proximate DNS services on the local network.

`--nogendata`, or `-g`: `false` (default) or `true`, skip the generation of the
readmeData.json file used for generating readme.md files.  This is useful if you are
generating host files with additional whitelists or blacklists and want to keep your
local checkout of this repo unmodified.

`--compress`, or `-c`: `false` (default) or `true`, *Compress* the hosts file
ignoring non-necessary lines (empty lines and comments) and putting multiple
domains in each line. Reducing the number of lines of the hosts file improves
the performances under Windows (with DNS Client service enabled).

`--minimise`, or `-m`: `false` (default) or `true`, like `--compress`, but puts
each domain on a separate line. This is necessary because many implementations
of URL blockers that rely on `hosts` files do not conform to the standard which
allows multiple hosts on a single line.

`--blacklist <blacklistfile>`, or `-x <blacklistfile>`: Append the given blacklist file
in hosts format to the generated hosts file.

`--whitelist <whitelistfile>`, or `-w <whitelistfile>`: Use the given whitelist file
to remove hosts from the generated hosts file.

#### Using NixOS:

To install hosts file on your machine add the following into your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  networking.extraHosts = let
    hostsPath = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts;
    hostsFile = builtins.fetchurl hostsPath;
  in builtins.readFile "${hostsFile}";
}
```

* NOTE: Change `hostsPath` if you need other versions of hosts file.
* NOTE: The call to `fetchurl` is impure.
Use `fetchFromGitHub` with the exact commit if you want to always get the same result.


## How do I control which sources are unified?

Add one or more *additional* sources, each in a subfolder of the `data/`
folder, and specify the `url` key in its `update.json` file.

Add one or more *optional* extensions, which originate from subfolders of the
`extensions/` folder.  Again the url in `update.json` controls where this
extension finds its updates.

Create an *optional* `blacklist` file. The contents of this file (containing a
listing of additional domains in `hosts` file format) are appended to the
unified hosts file during the update process. A sample `blacklist` is
included, and may be modified as you need.

* NOTE: The `blacklist` is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't
be overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.

### How do I include my own custom domain mappings?

If you have custom hosts records, place them in file `myhosts`.  The contents
of this file are prepended to the unified hosts file during the update
process.

The `myhosts` file is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be
overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.

### How do I prevent domains from being included?

The domains you list in the `whitelist` file are excluded from the final hosts
file.

The `whitelist` uses partial matching.  Therefore if you whitelist
`google-analytics.com`, that domain and all its subdomains won't be merged
into the final hosts file.

The `whitelist` is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be
overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.

## How can I contribute hosts records?

If you discover sketchy domains you feel should be included here, here are some ways to contribute them.

### Option 1: contact one of our hosts sources

The best way to get new domains included is to submit an issue to any of the data providers whose home pages are [listed here](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts#sources-of-hosts-data-unified-in-this-variant). This is best because once you submit new domains, they will be curated and updated by the dedicated folks who maintain these sources.

### Option 2: Fork this repository, add your domains to Steven Black's personal data file, and submit a pull request

Fork this hosts this repo and add your links to [https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/data/StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/data/StevenBlack/hosts).

Then, submit a pull request.

**WARNING**: this is less desirable than Option 1 because the ongoing curation falls on us. So this creates more work for us.

### Option 3: create your own hosts list as a repo on GitHub

If you're able to curate your own collection of sketchy domains, then curate your own hosts list.  Then signal the existence of your repo as [a new issue](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/issues) and we may include your new repo into the collection of sources we pull whenever we create new versions.


## What is a hosts file?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file
used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`.
Therefore if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never
leaves your computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware,
and other irritants.

For example, to nullify requests to some doubleclick.net servers, adding these
lines to your hosts file will do it:

```text
# block doubleClick's servers
0.0.0.0 ad.ae.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.ar.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.at.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.au.doubleclick.net
0.0.0.0 ad.be.doubleclick.net
# etc...
```

## We recommend using `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`

Traditionally most host files use `127.0.0.1`, the *loopback address*, to establish an IP connection to the local machine.

We prefer to use `0.0.0.0`, which is defined as a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target.

Using `0.0.0.0` is empirically faster, possibly because there's no wait for a timeout resolution. It also does not
interfere with a web server that may be running on the local PC.

## Why not use `0` instead of `0.0.0.0`?

We tried that.  Using `0` doesn't work universally.


## Location of your hosts file

To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text
editor.

**macOS (until 10.14.x macOS Mojave), iOS, Android, Linux**: `/etc/hosts` file.

**macOS Catalina:** `/private/etc/hosts` file.

**Windows**: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` file.

## Gentoo

Gentoo users may find [`sb-hosts`](https://github.com/PF4Public/gentoo-overlay/tree/master/net-misc/sb-hosts) in [::pf4public](https://github.com/PF4Public/gentoo-overlay) Gentoo overlay

## Updating hosts file on Windows

(NOTE: See also some third-party Hosts managers, listed below.)

On Linux and macOS, run the Python script. On Windows more
work is required due to compatibility issues so it's preferable to run the batch file as follows:

```sh
updateHostsWindows.bat
```

This file **MUST** be run in command prompt with administrator privileges in
the repository directory. In addition to updating the hosts file, it can also
replace the existing hosts file, and reload the DNS cache. It goes without
saying that for this to work, you must be connected to the internet.

To open a command prompt as administrator in the repository's directory, do the following:

**Windows XP**: Start → Run → `cmd`

**Windows Vista, 7**: Start Button → type `cmd` → right-click Command Prompt →
"Run as Administrator"

**Windows 8**: Start → Swipe Up → All Apps → Windows System → right-click Command Prompt →
"Run as Administrator"

**Windows 10**: Start Button → type `cmd` → right-click Command Prompt →
"Run as Administrator"

You can also refer to the "Third-Party Hosts Managers" section for further recommended solutions from third parties.

## Reloading hosts file

Your operating system will cache DNS lookups. You can either reboot or run the following commands to
manually flush your DNS cache once the new hosts file is in place.

| The Google Chrome browser may require manually cleaning up its DNS Cache on `chrome://net-internals/#dns` page to thereafter see the changes in your hosts file. See: <https://superuser.com/questions/723703>
:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Windows

Open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run this command:

```bat
ipconfig /flushdns
```

### Linux

Open a Terminal and run with root privileges:

**Debian/Ubuntu** `sudo service network-manager restart`

**Linux Mint** `sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean start`

**Linux with systemd**: `sudo systemctl restart network.service`

**Fedora Linux**: `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`

**Arch Linux/Manjaro with Network Manager**: `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`

**Arch Linux/Manjaro with Wicd**: `sudo systemctl restart wicd.service`

**RHEL/Centos**: `sudo /etc/init.d/network restart`

**FreeBSD**: `sudo service nscd restart`

To enable the `nscd` daemon initially, it is recommended that you run the following commands:

```sh
sudo sysrc nscd_enable="YES"
sudo service nscd start
```

Then modify the `hosts` line in your `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file to the following:

```text
hosts: cache files dns
```

**Others**: Consult [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29#Location_in_the_file_system).

### macOS

Open a Terminal and run:

```sh
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

## Release management

This repository uses [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it), an excellent CLI release
tool for GitHub repos and npm packages, to automate creating [releases](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/releases).
This is why the [package.json](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/package.json) and
[.release-it.json](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/.release-it.json) files are bundled.

## Goals of this unified hosts file

The goals of this repo are to:

1. automatically combine high-quality lists of hosts,

2. provide situation-appropriate extensions,

3. de-dupe the resultant combined list,

4. and keep the resultant file reasonably sized.

A high-quality source is defined here as one that is actively curated.  A
hosts source should be frequently updated by its maintainers with both
additions and removals.  The larger the hosts file, the higher the level of
curation is expected.

It is expected that this unified hosts file will serve both desktop and mobile
devices under a variety of operating systems.

## Third-Party Hosts Managers

* [Unified Hosts AutoUpdate](https://github.com/ScriptTiger/Unified-Hosts-AutoUpdate "Unified Hosts AutoUpdate") (for Windows): The Unified Hosts AutoUpdate package is purpose-built for this unified hosts project as well as in active development by community members. You can install and uninstall any blacklist and keep it automatically up to date, and can be placed in a shared network location and deployed across an organization via group policies. And since it is in active development by community members, your bug reports, feature requests, and other feedback are most welcome.

* [Maza ad blocking](https://github.com/tanrax/maza-ad-blocking) is a bash script that automatically updates host file. You can also update a fresh copy. And each time it generates a dnsmasq-compatible configuration file. Fast installation, compatible with MacOS, Linux and BSD.

* [Hostile](https://github.com/feross/hostile) is a nifty command line utility to easily add or remove domains from your hosts file.  If our hosts files are too aggressive for you, you can use `hostile` to remove domains, or you can use `hostile` in a bash script to automate a post process each time you download fresh versions of hosts.

* [macOS Scripting for Configuration, Backup and Restore](https://github.com/tiiiecherle/osx_install_config) helps customizing, re-installing and using macOS. It also provides a [script](https://github.com/tiiiecherle/osx_install_config/blob/master/09_launchd/9b_run_on_boot/root/1_hosts_file/launchd_and_script/hosts_file_generator.sh) to install and update the hosts file using this project on macOS. In combination with a [launchd](https://github.com/tiiiecherle/osx_install_config/blob/master/09_launchd/9b_run_on_boot/root/1_hosts_file/launchd_and_script/com.hostsfile.install_update.plist) it updates the hosts file every x days (default is 4). To install both download the GitHub repo and run the [install script](https://github.com/tiiiecherle/osx_install_config/blob/master/09_launchd/9b_run_on_boot/root/1_hosts_file/install_hosts_file_generator_and_launchdservice.sh) from the directory one level up.

* [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) is a network-wide DHCP server and ad blocker that runs on [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi). Pi-hole uses this repository as one of its sources. This is a very interesting project to set up yourself, or you can [buy one pre-loaded](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/pi-hole-poe-edition-the-network-wide-ad-blocker).

* [Block ads and malware via local BIND9 DNS server](https://github.com/mueller-ma/block-ads-via-dns "Block ads and malware via local DNS server") (for Debian, Raspbian & Ubuntu): Set up a local DNS server with a `/etc/bind/named.conf.blocked` file, sourced from here.

* [Block ads, malware, and deploy parental controls via local DualServer DNS/DHCP server](https://scripttiger.github.io/dualserver/ "Block ads, malware, and deploy parental controls via local DualServer DNS/DHCP server") (for BSD, Windows & Linux): Set up a blacklist for everyone on your network using the power of the unified hosts reformatted for DualServer. And if you're on Windows, this project also maintains an update script to make updating DualServer's blacklist even easier.

* [Blocking ads and malwares with unbound](https://deadc0de.re/articles/unbound-blocking-ads.html "Blocking ads and malwares with unbound") – [Unbound](https://www.unbound.net/ "Unbound is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver.") is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver.

* [dnsmasq conversion script](https://gist.github.com/erlepereira/c11f4f7a3f60cd2071e79018e895fc8a#file-dnsmasq-antimalware) This GitHub gist has a short shell script (bash, will work on any 'nix) and uses `wget` & `awk` present in most distros, to fetch a specified hosts file and convert it the format required by dnsmasq. Supports IPv4 and IPv6. Designed to be used as either a shell script, or can be dropped into /etc/cron.weekly (or wherever suits). The script is short and easily edited, also has a short document attached with notes on dnsmasq setup.
