# Unified hosts file with fakenews, gambling, social extensions

This repository consolidates several reputable `hosts` files, and merges them
into a unified hosts file with duplicates removed.  A variety of tailored hosts files are provided.

* Last updated: **December 08 2017**.
* Here's the [raw hosts file with fakenews, gambling, social extensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-social/hosts) containing 45,350 entries.


### List of all hosts file variants

The **Non GitHub mirror** is the link to use for some hosts file managers like
[Hostsman for Windows](http://www.abelhadigital.com/hostsman) that don't work
with Github download links.

## Extensions
The unified hosts file is extensible.  You manage extensions by curating the
`extensions/` folder tree. See the `fakenews`, `social`, `gambling`, and `porn` extension
folders.

## Generate your own unified hosts file

To run unit tests, in the top level directory, just run:

    python testUpdateHostsFile.py

**Note** if you are using Python 2, you must first install the `mock` library:

    pip install mock

The `updateHostsFile.py` script, which is Python 2.7 and Python 3-compatible,
will generate a unified hosts file based on the sources in the local `data/`
subfolder.  The script will prompt you whether it should fetch updated
versions (from locations defined by the `update.json` text file in each
source's folder). Otherwise, it will use the `hosts` file that's already there.

### Usage

#### Using Python 3:

    python3 updateHostsFile.py [--auto] [--replace] [--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn] [--extensions ext1 ext2 ext3]

#### Using Python 2.7:

    python updateHostsFile.py [--auto] [--replace] [--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn] [--extensions ext1 ext2 ext3]

#### Command line options:

`--help`, or `-h`: display help.

`--auto`, or `-a`: run the script without prompting. When `--auto` is invoked,

* Hosts data sources, including extensions, are updated.
* No extensions are included by default.  Use the `--extensions` or `-e` flag
to include any you want.
* Your active hosts file is *not* replaced unless you include the `--replace`
flag.

`--backup`, or `-b`: Make a backup of existing hosts file(s) as you generate
over them.

`--extensions <ext1> <ext2> <ext3>`, or `-e <ext1> <ext2> <ext3>`: the names
of subfolders below the `extensions` folder containing additional
category-specific hosts files to include in the amalgamation. Example:
`--extensions porn` or `-e social porn`.

`--flush-dns-cache`, or `-f`: skip the prompt for flushing the DNS cache.  
Only active when `--replace` is also active.

`--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn`, or `-i nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn`: the IP address to use as the
target.  Default is `0.0.0.0`.

`--keepdomaincomments`, or `-k`: `false` (default) or `true`, keep the comments
that appear on the same line as domains.  The default is `false` since some
router-based implementations can't handle comments in-line with hosts.

`--skipstatichosts`, or `-s`: `false` (default) or `true`,

`--noupdate`, or `-n`: skip fetching updates from hosts data sources.

`--output <subfolder>`, or `-o <subfolder>`: place the generated source file
in a subfolder.  If the subfolder does not exist, it will be created.

`--replace`, or `-r`: trigger replacing your active hosts

`--skipstatichosts`, or `-s`: `false` (default) or `true`, omit the standard
section at the top, containing lines like `127.0.0.1 localhost`.  This is
useful for configuring proximate DNS services on the local network.

## How do I control which sources are unified?

Add one or more  *additional* sources, each in a subfolder of the `data/`
folder, and specify the `url` key in its `update.json` file.

Add one or more *optional* extensions, which originate from subfolders of the
`extensions/` folder.  Again the url in `update.json` controls where this
extension finds its updates.

Create an *optional* `blacklist` file. The contents of this file (containing a
listing of additional domains in `hosts` file format) are appended to the
unified hosts file during the update process. A sample `blacklist` is
included, and may be modified as you desire.

  * NOTE: The `blacklist` is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't
be overridden when you `git pull`   this repo from `origin` in the future.

### How do I include my own custom domain mappings?

If you have custom hosts records, place them in file `myhosts`.  The contents
of this file are prepended to the unified hosts file during the update
process.

The `myhosts` file is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be
overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.

### How do I prevent domains from being included?

The domains you list in the `whitelist` file are excluded from the final hosts
file.

The `whitelist` uses partial matching.  Therefore if you whitelist
`google-analytics.com`, that domain and all its subdomains won't be merged
into the final hosts file.

The `whitelist` is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be
overridden when you `git pull` this repo  from `origin` in the future.


## What is a hosts file?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file
used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`.
Therefore if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never
leaves your computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware,
and other irritants.

For example, to nullify requests to some doubleclick.net servers, adding these
lines to your hosts file will do it:

    # block doubleClick's servers
    0.0.0.0 ad.ae.doubleclick.net
    0.0.0.0 ad.ar.doubleclick.net
    0.0.0.0 ad.at.doubleclick.net
    0.0.0.0 ad.au.doubleclick.net
    0.0.0.0 ad.be.doubleclick.net
    # etc...


## We recommend using `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`

Traditionally most host files use `127.0.0.1`, the *loopback address*, to establish an IP connection to the local machine.

We prefer to use `0.0.0.0`, which is defined as a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown,
or non applicable target.

Using `0.0.0.0` is empirically faster, possibly because there's no wait for a timeout resolution. It also does not
interfere with a web server that may be running on the local PC.

## Why not use just `0` instead of `0.0.0.0`?
We tried that.  Using `0` doesn't work universally.


## Location of your hosts file
To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text
editor.

**Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Linux**: `/etc/hosts` folder.

**Windows**: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` folder.

## Updating hosts file on Windows

On Linux and Mac OS X, you can simply run the Python script, but on Windows, more
work is required due to compatibility issues in implementing some of the functionality
for Windows. It is preferable to run the batch file as follows:

```
updateHostsWindows.bat
```

This file MUST be run in command prompt with administrator privileges in
the repository directory. In addition to updating the hosts file, it can also
replace the existing hosts file, and reload the DNS cache. It goes without
saying that in order for this to work, you must be connected to the internet.

To open a command prompt as administrator in the repository's directory, do the following:

**Windows XP**: Start -> Run -> `cmd`

**Windows Vista, 7**: Start Button -> type `cmd` -> right-click Command Prompt ->
"Run as Administrator"

**Windows 8**: Start -> Swipe Up -> All Apps -> Windows System -> right-click Command Prompt ->
"Run as Administrator"

**Windows 10**: Start Button -> type `cmd` -> right-click Command Prompt ->
"Run as Administrator"

You can also refer to the "Third-Party Hosts Managers" section for further recommended solutions from third parties.

## Reloading hosts file
Your operating system will cache DNS lookups. You can either reboot or run the following commands to
manually flush your DNS cache once the new hosts file is in place.

### Windows

Open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run this command:

```
ipconfig /flushdns
```

|If you want to use a huge hosts file by merging [hphosts](https://www.hosts-file.net) (NOT INCLUDED HERE) you need to DISABLE and STOP `Dnscache` service before you replace hosts file in Windows Systems. You have been warned.|
:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before flushing the DNS cache, open a command prompt with administrator privileges and run this command:

```
sc config "Dnscache" start= disabled
sc stop "Dnscache"
```

### Linux

Open a Terminal and run with root privileges:

**Debian/Ubuntu** `sudo /etc/rc.d/init.d/nscd restart`

**Linux with systemd**: `sudo systemctl restart network.service`

**Fedora Linux**: `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`

**Arch Linux/Manjaro with Network Manager**: `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`

**Arch Linux/Manjaro with Wicd**: `sudo systemctl restart wicd.service`

**Others**: Consult [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29#Location_in_the_file_system).

### Mac OS X

Open a Terminal and run:
```
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

## Goals of this unified hosts file

The goals of this repo are to:

1. automatically combine high-quality lists of hosts,

2. provide easy extensions,

3. de-dupe the resultant combined list,

4. and keep the resultant file reasonably sized.

A high-quality source is defined here as one that is actively curated.  A
hosts source should be frequently updated by its maintainers with both
additions and removals.  The larger the hosts file, the higher the level of
curation is expected.

For example, the (huge) hosts file from [hosts-file.net](https://hosts-file.net)
is **not** included here because it is very large (780,000+ entries)
and doesn't currently display a corresponding high level of curation activity.

It is expected that this unified hosts file will serve both desktop and mobile
devices under a variety of operating systems.

## Third-Party Hosts Managers

* [Unified Hosts AutoUpdate](https://github.com/ScriptTiger/Unified-Hosts-AutoUpdate "Unified Hosts AutoUpdate") (for Windows): The Unified Hosts AutUpdate package is purpose-built for this unified hosts project as well as in active development by community members. It's sophisticated enough to allow any novice the ability to install and uninstall the blacklist of their choosing to their local hosts file and keep it automatically up to date, while also being minimal enough to be able to be easily placed in a shared network location and deployed across an organization via group policies. And since it is in active development by community members, your bug reports, feature requests, and other feedback are most welcome.

## Interesting Applications

* [Block ads and malware via local BIND9 DNS server](https://github.com/mueller-ma/block-ads-via-dns "Block ads and malware via local DNS server") (for Debian, Raspbian & Ubuntu): Set up a local DNS server with a `/etc/bind/named.conf.blocked` file, sourced from here.

* [Block ads, malware, and deploy parental controls via local DualServer DNS/DHCP server](https://scripttiger.github.io/dualserver "Block ads, malware, and deploy parental controls via local DualServer DNS/DHCP server") (for BSD, Windows & Linux): Set up a blacklist for everyone on your network using the power of the unified hosts reformatted for DualServer. And if you're on Windows, this project also maintains an update script to make updating DualServer's blacklist even easier.

* [Blocking ads and malwares with unbound](https://deadc0de.re/articles/unbound-blocking-ads.html "Blocking ads and malwares with unbound") – [Unbound](https://www.unbound.net/ "Unbound is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver.")  is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver.
